# Personal-Spending-Analysis

This is a personal project that analyses my spending habits between the years 2022 and 2023. It comprises a database that stores 9 different categories/Types of expenses and 28 subcategories. It also contains 24 columns that store the expenses for the 24 months from January 2022 to December 2023.

The table was created by me and was cleaned before being used for this project on Excel. The project uses the Pandas, Numpy and Matpltolib libraries to analyse, sort and create visualizations about my spending habits in the last 2 years.

The goal of the project is to answer basic questions to give me insight into my spending. The questions are as follows:
1. Which category of expenses do I spend most on? Did this category change over 6 months?

2. Which categories make up the largest and smallest portions of my spending?

3. Within the category that I spent most on, what trends am I seeing?
I always reduce spending from Sep to Dec as it is the start of the semester so I tend to eat less because of school work and being busy.

4. What percentage of your total spending goes to each category(Type)?

5. Are there any categories where expenses vary significantly month-to-month? If so, what factors contribute to this variation?

6. Are there any categories where costs have increased compared to previous months? What might be the reasons behind these increases?

7. How much are you spending on debt repayment (e.g., credit card)? Could you increase this to pay off debt faster?

Answers:
1. Housing. Housing remained my most expensive expenditure throughout the 2 years timeframe.

2. The 3 largest portions of my spending were Housing, Food and Insurance as you can see from the second image. While the smallest portion of my expenditure was Gifts and Donations.

3. There was no real trend in my Housing expense except for the $25 increase when I moved to a new place in 2023.
For food, My spending began to decrease from September to December due to the beginning of the semester which led me to eat less because of school work, stress and being more busy overall than in summer.

4. The Pie chart in the third image shows all my expenditures as a percentage of the total expenditure throughout the 2 years.

5. Shopping varies considerably from month to month. I tend to spend a lot in April and December because the semester ends in these months and I celebrate these occasions by treating myself to a gift.

6. At the start of the new year, I made financial goals which led me to spend less on my credit card debt (Debt).
April and May â€˜23 costs increased for shopping because I travelled to celebrate the end of the semester and I bought new soccer boots.

7. I should increase how much I spend repaying my credit card debt as it is too low.
